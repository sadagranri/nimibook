# What is Spoonexebuilder and how to use it?
 
Spoonexebuilder is a tool that allows you to create and manipulate abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of Java source code. It is based on Spoon, an open-source library to analyze, rewrite, transform, transpile Java source code[^4^]. Spoonexebuilder can help you perform various tasks on Java code, such as:

- Visualize the AST of a Java file
- Apply transformations and refactorings on the code
- Write custom analyses and processors on the code
- Generate new code from existing code

To use Spoonexebuilder, you need to have Java 11 or later installed on your machine. You also need to download the spoon-core-10.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/fr.inria.gforge.spoon/spoon-core). Then, you can run Spoonexebuilder from the command line as follows:

    java -cp spoon-core-10.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar spoon.SpoonModelBuilder [options] [source files]

The options are:

- -i: specify the input source files or directories
- -o: specify the output directory where the transformed code will be generated
- -p: specify the fully qualified name of a processor class to apply on the code
- --gui: launch a graphical user interface to visualize the AST of a Java file
- --help: display the help message

For more information and examples, please refer to the [official documentation](https://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/) of Spoon and Spoonexebuilder.
  
Spoonexebuilder is a powerful tool for Java developers who want to manipulate and transform their code in a flexible and efficient way. It allows you to write custom processors that can perform any kind of analysis or transformation on the code, such as:

- Adding or removing annotations
- Renaming or moving methods or classes
- Inserting or deleting statements or expressions
- Changing the visibility or modifiers of elements
- Generating test cases or assertions

To write a processor, you need to extend the spoon.processing.AbstractProcessor class and implement the process method. The process method takes as input a CtElement, which represents any element of the Java AST, such as a class, a method, a field, a statement, etc. You can use the Spoon API to query and modify the CtElement and its children. You can also use the Factory and Environment classes to create new elements or access global settings. For example, here is a simple processor that adds a @Deprecated annotation to all public methods:

    import spoon.processing.AbstractProcessor;
    import spoon.reflect.declaration.CtMethod;
    import spoon.reflect.declaration.ModifierKind;
    
    public class DeprecatedProcessor extends AbstractProcessor> 
      @Override
      public void process(CtMethod element) 
        // check if the method is public
        if (element.hasModifier(ModifierKind.PUBLIC)) 
          // add a @Deprecated annotation
          element.addAnnotation(getFactory().createAnnotation(getFactory().createCtTypeReference(Deprecated.class)));

To run this processor on your code, you need to pass its fully qualified name to the -p option of Spoonexebuilder. For example:

    java -cp spoon-core-10.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar spoon.SpoonModelBuilder -i src/main/java -o src/main/java/spooned -p DeprecatedProcessor

This will transform all the public methods in the src/main/java directory and generate the modified code in the src/main/java/spooned directory.
